Plan
Objective: Develop a chatbot that analyzes uploaded CSV data using pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for classification or regression (if applicable), and joblib for model persistence.
Approach: Train a simple classifier (e.g., using train_test_split and a model like LogisticRegression) on sample data or user-uploaded data, and let the chatbot answer questions based on predictions or stats.
Libraries Used: pandas (data handling), numpy (numerical ops), sklearn (ML models/metrics), joblib (model saving).

Data Manipulation: Using pandas to process and analyze CSV data.
Machine Learning: Using sklearn for classification or anomaly detection (if needed) to flag potential issues beyond rule-based validation.
Model Persistence: Using joblib to save and load trained models for consistent performance.
Integration: Work seamlessly with MongoDB-stored validation logs and the existing VALIDATION_RULES.

pandas: For CSV data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations in ML preprocessing.
sklearn: For LogisticRegression, train_test_split, and metrics (confusion_matrix, precision_score, etc.).
joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.
motor.motor_asyncio and bson: For MongoDB integration.
